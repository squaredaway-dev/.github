### Squared Away 

Squared Away is an exploration and reimagining of what spreadsheets could be. It's still
very much a work in progress, but the goal is to make spreadsheet-esque development 
environments a sane and valid choice for a team collaborating on production grade software.

The recipe isn't quite right yet, but here are some of the ingredients being tested.
- A statically typed formula language (completely inferred) for safe development with helpful error messages
- A system of actually naming things instead of A:67 style cell references to make formulas less cryptic
  (if it's not readable, it's not maintainable)
- Testing as a first class citizen
- Compiling to custom bytecode for lighting fast performance on large datasets 
- Diff based contributions for teams maintaining programs together.
